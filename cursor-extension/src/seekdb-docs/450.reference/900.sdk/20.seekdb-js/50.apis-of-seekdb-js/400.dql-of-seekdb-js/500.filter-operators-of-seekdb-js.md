# Operators

Operators are generally used to connect operands or parameters and return results. In terms of syntax, operators can appear before, after, or between operands.

## Operator examples

### Data filtering (where)

#### Equal to

Use `$eq` to indicate equal to, as follows:

```js
where: { category: { $eq: "AI" } }
```

You can also use the shorthand form, as follows:

```js
where: { category: "AI" }
```

#### Not equal to

Use `$ne` to indicate not equal to, as follows:

```js
where: { category: { $ne: "ML" } }
```

#### Greater than

Use `$gt` to indicate greater than, as follows:

```js
where: { score: { $gt: 80 } }
```

#### Greater than or equal to

Use `$gte` to indicate greater than or equal to, as follows:

```js
where: { score: { $gte: 90 } }
```

#### Less than

Use `$lt` to indicate less than, as follows:

```js
where: { score: { $lt: 60 } }
```

#### Less than or equal to

Use `$lte` to indicate less than or equal to, as follows:

```js
where: { score: { $lte: 50 } }
```

#### Contains

Use `$in` to indicate contains, as follows:

```js
where: { tag: { $in: ["ml", "python", "ai"] } }
```

#### Does not contain

Use `$nin` to indicate does not contain, as follows:

```js
where: { tag: { $nin: ["deprecated", "obsolete"] } }
```

#### Logical OR

Use `$or` to indicate logical OR, as follows:

```js
where: {
    $or: [
      { category: "AI" },
      { category: "ML" }
    ]
  }
```

#### Logical AND

Use `$and` to indicate logical AND, as follows:

```js
where: {
    $and: [
      { category: { $eq: "AI" } },
      { score: { $gte: 90 } }
    ]
  }
```

### Text filtering (where_document)

#### Full-text search (contains substring)

Use `$contains` to indicate full-text search, as follows:

```js
whereDocument: { $contains: "machine learning" }
```

#### Regular expression

Use `$regex` to indicate regular expression, as follows:

```js
whereDocument: { $regex: "AI|ML|DL" }
```

#### Logical OR

Use `$or` to indicate logical OR, as follows:

```js
whereDocument: {
    $or: [
      { $contains: "AI" },
      { $contains: "artificial intelligence" }
    ]
  }
```

#### Logical AND

Use `$and` to indicate logical AND, as follows:

```js
whereDocument: {
    $and: [
      { $contains: "machine learning" },
      { $contains: "deep learning" }
    ]
  }
```
