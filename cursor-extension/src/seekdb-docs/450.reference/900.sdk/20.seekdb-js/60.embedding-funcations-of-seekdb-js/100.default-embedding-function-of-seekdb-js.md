# Default embedded functions

Vector functions convert text documents into vector embeddings for similarity search. seekdb-js supports both built-in and custom vector functions.

The default vector function uses a local model (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) without requiring an API key. It is ideal for quick development and testing.

```js
// Use default configuration (automatically uses the default vector function)
const collection = await client.createCollection({
  name: "local_embed_collection"
});
```

The model will be automatically downloaded the first time you perform vectorization. This process typically takes 3-5 minutes, depending on your network conditions. Please be patient.

seekdb-js also allows you to manually import built-in models using the following command:

```shell
npm install @seekdb/default-embed
```

Here is an example of using a built-in function:

```python
import { DefaultEmbeddingFunction } from "@seekdb/default-embed";

const defaultEmbed = new DefaultEmbeddingFunction({
  // If you encounter download issues, try switching regions. The default is 'cn'.
  // region: 'intl'
});

const collection = await client.createCollection({
  name: "local_embed_collection",
  embeddingFunction: defaultEmbed
});
```
