# Tencent Hunyuan

Tencent Hunyuan is a general-purpose large language model developed by Tencent. It performs well on content generation, math and logic, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. The embedding API (GetEmbedding) converts input text into 1024-dimensional vectors, which you can use for RAG, agent memory, and other applications that rely on semantic understanding.

## Dependencies and authentication

- Install the `pyseekdb` package.
- Create a Tencent Hunyuan API key for authentication.

## Example: create a Tencent Hunyuan embedding function

Import and initialize `TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction`. Authentication is usually provided via environment variables.

- Basic usage

    Initialization without arguments uses the default environment variable `HUNYUAN_API_KEY` for the API key.

    ```python
    from pyseekdb.utils.embedding_functions import TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction

    ef = TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction()
    ```

- Custom configuration

    You can override the environment variable name and set optional parameters such as `timeout`. When using separate secret ID and secret key, use `secret_id_env` and `secret_key_env` to specify their environment variable names.

    ```python
    from pyseekdb.utils.embedding_functions import TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction

    ef = TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction(
        api_key_env="HUNYUAN_API_KEY",
        timeout=30
    )
    ```

**Parameters:**

* `model_name`: Tencent Hunyuan embedding model name.
* `api_key_env`: Environment variable name for the API key (default: `HUNYUAN_API_KEY`).
* `timeout`: Request timeout (seconds), optional.
