# Tencent Hunyuan

Tencent Hunyuan is a general-purpose large language model developed by Tencent. It performs well on content generation, math and logic, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. The embedding API (GetEmbedding) converts input text into 1024-dimensional vectors for RAG, agent memory, and other applications that rely on semantic understanding. seekdb provides `TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction` so you can use these embeddings with seekdb collections.

## Dependencies and authentication

- Install the `@seekdb/tencent-hunyuan` package.
- Create a Tencent Hunyuan API key for authentication.

## Example: create a Tencent Hunyuan embedding function

Call the `TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction` constructor with an optional config object. Without config, the function reads the API key from the default environment variable `HUNYUAN_API_KEY`.

```javascript
import { TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction } from "@seekdb/tencent-hunyuan";

const ef = new TencentHunyuanEmbeddingFunction({
  // Specify the Tencent Hunyuan embedding model.
  modelName: "hunyuan-embedding",
});
```

**Configurations:**

- **modelName**: Tencent Hunyuan embedding model name (default: `hunyuan-embedding`).
- **api_key_env**: Environment variable name for the API key (default: `HUNYUAN_API_KEY`).
