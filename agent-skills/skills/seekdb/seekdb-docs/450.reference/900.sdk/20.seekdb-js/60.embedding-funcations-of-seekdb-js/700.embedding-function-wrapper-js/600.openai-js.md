# OpenAI

OpenAI embedding models convert text (words, sentences, or paragraphs) into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors capture semantic meaning so you can measure similarity (for example, via cosine similarity) without extra training. Typical use cases include semantic search, question answering, text clustering and classification, recommendation systems, and RAG.

## Dependencies and authentication

- Install the `@seekdb/openai` package.
- In Node you can use the official OpenAI JavaScript SDK; in the browser you can use the `fetch` API instead.
- Create an API key in the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) and set it in your environment or pass it in code.

## Example: create an OpenAI embedding function

Call the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction` constructor with an optional config object.

- Basic usage:

    Omit the config to use the default model and the API key from the environment.

    ```javascript
    import { OpenAIEmbeddingFunction } from "@seekdb/openai";

    const ef = new OpenAIEmbeddingFunction();
    ```

- Advanced usage:

    Override the API key environment variable and set `modelName`, `baseURL`, and other options as needed.

    ```javascript
    import { OpenAIEmbeddingFunction } from "@seekdb/openai";

    const ef = new OpenAIEmbeddingFunction({
      modelName: "text-embedding-3-small",
      // baseURL: "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    });
    ```

**Configurations:**

- **apiKey**: API key (optional; can be provided via the environment).
- **apiKeyEnvVar**: Environment variable name for the API key (default: `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- **modelName**: Model name (default: `text-embedding-3-small`).
- **dimensions**: Output dimension (optional).
- **organizationId**: Organization ID (optional; default: `process.env.OPENAI_ORG_ID`).
- **baseURL**: Custom base URL (optional).
