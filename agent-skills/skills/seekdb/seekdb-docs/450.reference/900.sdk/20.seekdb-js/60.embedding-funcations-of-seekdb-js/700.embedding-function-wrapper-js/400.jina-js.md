## Dependencies and authentication

- Have a Jina API key with access to the embedding models you plan to use.
- You can pass the key in code or set it in an environment variable (default: `JINA_API_KEY`). Use `apiKeyEnvVar` if you use a different variable name.

## Installation

```bash
npm i seekdb @seekdb/jina
```

## Example: create a Jina embedding function

```typescript
import { JinaEmbeddingFunction } from "@seekdb/jina";

const ef = new JinaEmbeddingFunction({
  modelName: "jina-clip-v2",
  // apiKeyEnvVar: "JINA_API_KEY",
});
```

**Configurations:**

- **apiKey**: Jina API key (optional; if omitted, read from the environment).
- **apiKeyEnvVar**: Environment variable name for the API key (default: `"JINA_API_KEY"`).
- **modelName**: Embedding model name (default: `"jina-clip-v2"`).
