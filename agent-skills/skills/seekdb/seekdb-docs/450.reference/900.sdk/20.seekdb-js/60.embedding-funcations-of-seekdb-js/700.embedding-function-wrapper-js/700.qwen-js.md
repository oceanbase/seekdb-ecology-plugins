# Qwen (Tongyi Qianwen)

Qwen embedding models are designed for text embedding and ranking. The family is based on Qwen3 dense foundation models and supports 100+ languages, long context (up to 32K tokens), and strong reasoning. seekdb provides `QwenEmbeddingFunction` so you can generate Qwen embeddings and use them with seekdb collections.

- Have permission to call the Qwen Embedding API (for example, a Dashscope API key).

## Example: create a Qwen embedding function

Call the `QwenEmbeddingFunction` constructor with an optional config object.

```typescript
import { QwenEmbeddingFunction } from "@seekdb/qwen";

const qwenEmbed = new QwenEmbeddingFunction({
  modelName: "text-embedding-v4",
});
```

**Configurations:**

- **apiKey**: Dashscope API key (optional; if omitted, read from the environment).
- **apiKeyEnvVar**: Environment variable name for the API key (default: `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`).
- **modelName**: Model name (default: `text-embedding-v4`).
- **dimensions**: Output dimension (default: `1024`).
- **region**: API region: `"cn"` (China) or `"intl"` (international) (default: `"cn"`).
