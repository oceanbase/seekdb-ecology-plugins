# createDatabase - Create a database

The `createDatabase()` method is used to create a new database.

:::info

* This API can only be used when connected with `SeekdbAdminClient`. For more information about `SeekdbAdminClient`, see [SeekdbAdminClient](../100.seekdbadminclient-of-seekdb-js.md).

* Currently, when you use `createDatabase`, you cannot specify the properties of the database. The database will be created with default values for all properties. If you want to create a database with specific properties, you can try creating it using SQL. For more information, see [Create a database](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001971662).

:::

## Prerequisites

* You have installed seekdb-js. For more information, see [Quick start](../../10.seekdb-js-get-started.md).

* You have installed the server mode of seekdb. For more information, see [Deploy seekdb by using yum install](../../../../../400.guides/400.deploy/700.server-mode/100.deploy-by-systemd.md).

* You are connected to the database. For more information, see [SeekdbAdminClient](../100.seekdbadminclient-of-seekdb-js.md).

* The user to which you are connected has the `CREATE` privilege. For more information about how to view the privileges of the current user, see [View user privileges](../../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/400.view-user-permissions.md). If the user does not have this privilege, contact the administrator to grant it. For more information about how to directly grant privileges, see [Directly grant privileges](../../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.direct-authority.md).

## Limitations

* In seekdb, the name of each database must be globally unique.

* The maximum length of a database name is 128 characters.

* The name can contain only uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dollar signs, and Chinese characters.

* Avoid using reserved keywords as database names.

  For more information about reserved keywords, see [Reserved keywords](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001970988).

## Considerations

* We recommend that you give the database a meaningful name that reflects its purpose and content. For example, you can use `app_id_subapp_name_db` as the database name.

* We recommend that you create the database and related users as the root user and grant only the necessary privileges to ensure the security and controllability of the database.

* You can create a database with a name that consists solely of digits by enclosing the name in backticks (\`). However, this is not recommended because such names lack clear meaning and require backticks when queried, which can lead to unnecessary complexity and confusion.
