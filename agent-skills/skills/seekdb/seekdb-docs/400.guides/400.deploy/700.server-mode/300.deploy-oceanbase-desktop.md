OceanBase Desktop offers:

* **Graphical interface**: A simple UI for common database tasks.
* **Database management**: Create and manage database instances.
* **Query execution**: Run SQL from an integrated command line.
* **Monitoring and logs**: View database status in real time.

    ## Check system requirements

    Before installing OceanBase Desktop on Windows, ensure your machine meets these requirements:

    * **Operating system:** Windows on x86-64. For WSL 2 you need Windows 10 version 1903 or later (build 18362 or later), or Windows 11.

    * **Resources:** At least 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, and 5 GB free disk space.

    You can verify your system as follows.

    * **Check Windows version**

      Press [Win] + [Q], search for **Settings**, and open it. In **Settings**, go to **System** and scroll to **About** to see your Windows build number.

    * **Check memory and CPU**
      
      Press [Win] + [Q], search for **Task Manager**, and open it. Open the **Performance** tab. Use the **CPU** and **Memory** tabs to see core count and memory usage.

    * **Check disk**
      
      Press [Win] + [Q], search for **File Explorer**, and open it. In the left pane, click **This PC** and check the drives under **Devices and drives**.

    ## Installation steps

    1. **Install dependencies**

       OceanBase Desktop on Windows uses WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), so you can run Linux binaries on Windows. Microsoft introduced WSL in 2016.

       Two versions exist: WSL 1 and WSL 2. WSL 1 provides a compatibility layer that translates Linux system calls to Windows. WSL 2 runs a real Linux kernel in a lightweight VM via Hyper-V, giving a much closer experience to native Linux.

       :::tip
       WSL 2 is not an upgrade of WSL 1; you can install WSL 2 directly. OceanBase Desktop only supports WSL 2.

       1. **Check if virtualization is enabled**

          Press [Win] + [Q], search for **Task Manager**, and open it. Go to the **Performance** tab and select **CPU**. If **Virtualization** shows **Enabled**, you are set. If it shows **Disabled**, enable it in BIOS as described next.

       2. **Enable virtualization in BIOS**

          The steps below use a ThinkPad (Lenovo) as an example. Other brands differ slightly; check your vendor’s support site, for example [Dell](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000195978/how-to-enable-or-disable-hardware-virtualization-on-dell-systems), [Lenovo](https://support.lenovo.com/us/zc/solutions/ht500006-how-to-enable-virtualization-technology-on-lenovo-computers), [ThinkPad](https://support.lenovo.com/us/zc/solutions/ht500006-how-to-enable-virtualization-technology-on-lenovo-computers), [HP](https://support.hp.com/us-en/search?q=enable+virtualization), or [Huawei](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/content/en-us15777885/).

          1. Open the **Start** menu, click **Power**, then **Restart**.
          2. As the machine restarts, press **F1** (or the key shown on screen) to enter BIOS.
          3. Go to **Security** → **Security Virtualization**.
          4. Set **Virtualization Technology** to **Enabled** (or **On**, depending on your BIOS).
          5. Choose **Save and Exit** and wait for the system to reboot.

          :::info
          You can confirm virtualization is on by opening Task Manager again and checking the **Virtualization** field under **Performance** → **CPU**.
