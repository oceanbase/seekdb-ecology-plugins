This package can be installed from PyPI and provides an interactive command-line installer that supports multiple AI coding tools:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install seekdb-agent-skills

# Run the interactive installer
seekdb-agent-skills
```

The interactive installer will guide you through the installation process:

1. **Project Root Confirmation**: The installer detects your current directory as the project root and asks for confirmation
2. **Tool Selection**: Choose one tool from the supported list (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, Codex, etc.)
3. **Skill Selection**: Select which skills to install (you can select multiple skills using Space key)
4. **Automatic Installation**: The installer automatically copies the selected skills to the correct directories for your chosen tool

**Supported Tools:**
- Claude Code (`.claude/skills`)
- OpenClaw (`.openclaw/skills`)
- Cursor (`.cursor/skills`)
- Codex (`.codex/skills`)
- OpenCode (`.opencode/skills`)
- GitHub Copilot (`.github/skills`)
- Qoder (`.qoder/skills`)
- Trae (`.trae/skills`)

**Interactive Features:**
- Navigate with arrow keys (↑↓)
- Select multiple skills with Space key
- Confirm with Enter
- Cancel anytime with Ctrl+C

#### Method 2: Through Marketplace (Claude Code)

Install with just two commands:

1. **Add the seekdb marketplace**  
   In Claude Code, run:  
   `/plugin marketplace add oceanbase/seekdb-ecology-plugins`

2. **Install the plugin**  
   `/plugin install seekdb-plugin@seekdb`

3. **Restart Claude Code**  
   After installation, exit and restart Claude Code to ensure the plugin loads correctly.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Required for the installer and when using the data import/query skills
- **Basic understanding of Agent Skills**: When using an AI coding tool that supports skills/plugins
- **Data import/query skills** also require the following Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pyseekdb pandas openpyxl
  ```

### Installing Claude Code

If you haven't installed Claude Code yet, install it globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

For other AI coding tools, please refer to their respective official documentation.

### Configure Environment Variables

Claude Code requires an API key to run. Please set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Set API key (required)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Set API Base URL (if using a proxy or custom endpoint)
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com"
```

> **Tip**: You can add these environment variables to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or other shell configuration files to persist the configuration.

### Configure seekdb Connection Mode

The `importing-to-seekdb` and `querying-from-seekdb` skills support two connection modes for seekdb:

**1. Embedded Mode (Default)**
- No additional configuration required
- Data is stored locally
- Simply run the scripts without setting any seekdb environment variables

**2. Server Mode**
- Connect to a remote seekdb server
- Configure the following environment variables:
  ```bash
  export SEEKDB_HOST=127.0.0.1
  export SEEKDB_PORT=2881
  export SEEKDB_USER=root
  export SEEKDB_PASSWORD=""
  export SEEKDB_DATABASE=test
  ```

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `SEEKDB_HOST` | Server host address (if set, enables server mode) | - |
| `SEEKDB_PORT` | Server port | 2881 |
| `SEEKDB_USER` | Username | root |
| `SEEKDB_PASSWORD` | Password | (empty) |
| `SEEKDB_DATABASE` | Database name | test |

> **Note**: If `SEEKDB_HOST` is not set, the scripts will automatically use embedded mode.

### Configure Network Settings

Since the seekdb skill plugin needs to fetch the latest documentation from GitHub, you need to configure Claude Code to allow network requests in your project directory.

Create or edit the `.claude/settings.local.json` file in your project root directory:

```json
{
  "skipWebFetchPreflight": true
}
```

> **Important Notes**:
> - Setting `skipWebFetchPreflight` to `true` skips the preflight check for network requests, allowing Claude to directly access remote documentation
> - If GitHub is not accessible, the plugin will automatically fall back to local documentation

### Installing the seekdb Plugin

Once Claude Code is installed, follow these steps to install the seekdb plugin:

1. **Add the seekdb Marketplace**
   
   Open Claude Code's terminal or command interface and run:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add oceanbase/seekdb-ecology-plugins
   ```
   
   This command adds the seekdb plugin marketplace to your Claude Code instance.

2. **Install the Plugin**
   
   After adding the marketplace, install the seekdb plugin:
   ```bash
   /plugin install seekdb-plugin@seekdb
   ```
   
   This will download and install the seekdb plugin along with all its skills.

3. **Restart Claude Code**
   
   After installing the plugin, restart Claude Code to ensure the plugin is fully loaded and ready to use.

### Configuration

The plugin is ready to use immediately after installation. No additional configuration is required. The skills will be automatically available to Claude Code when you ask seekdb-related questions.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Using seekdb-docs

Ask Claude Code seekdb-related technical questions:

```
How to deploy a seekdb test environment?
```

```
How to use seekdb's vector search functionality?
```

```
How to implement hybrid search in seekdb?
```

```
Which AI framework integrations does seekdb support?
```

Claude Code will automatically search the documentation library and provide accurate technical guidance.

### Using importing-to-seekdb

Import data files into seekdb with optional vectorization:

**Example 1: Preview Excel file before importing**
```
View the sample Excel data in the importing-to-seekdb skill
```

Claude Code will use `read_excel.py` to display the file structure and preview data:
```
File: sample_products.xlsx (11.5 KB)
Columns: Name, Brand, Selling Price, MRP, Discount, Ratings, No_of_ratings, Details
Records: 9 mobile phone products
```

**Example 2: Import Excel data with vectorization**
```
Import sample_products.xlsx into seekdb database, vectorize the Details column
```

Claude Code will:
1. Ask which column to vectorize (e.g., Details for semantic search)
2. Ask for collection name (default: derived from filename)
3. Execute the import with automatic embedding generation

```
Import Result:
- Collection: sample_products
- Records: 9
- Vectorized column: Details (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dimensions)
- Metadata fields: MRP, Name, Brand, Ratings, Discount, No_of_ratings, Selling Price
```

### Using querying-from-seekdb

Query data from seekdb with hybrid search and export capabilities:

**Example 1: Semantic search with metadata filtering**
```
Recommend 2 phones with rating above 4.3 and AMOLED screen
```

Claude Code will:
1. First run `--info` to understand the collection structure
2. Construct a query combining metadata filter (`Ratings >= 4.3`) and semantic search (`AMOLED screen`)
3. Return matching results ranked by relevance

```
Found 2 results:
1. POCO M4 Pro (Power Black 64 GB)
   - Brand: POCO
   - Rating: 4.3
   - Price: 10,999
   - Screen: 16.33 cm Full HD+ AMOLED Display

2. POCO M4 Pro (Power Black 128 GB)
   - Brand: POCO
   - Rating: 4.3
   - Price: 11,999
   - Screen: 16.33 cm Full HD+ AMOLED Display
```

**Example 2: Query and export to Excel**
```
Recommend 2 phones with rating above 4.3 and AMOLED screen, export to Excel
```

Claude Code will execute the search and export specified fields to an Excel file:
```
Exported 2 records to: amoled_phones.xlsx

┌─────┬──────────────────────────────────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────┐
│  #  │               Name               │ Brand │ Ratings │  Price  │ Discount │
├─────┼──────────────────────────────────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ 1   │ POCO M4 Pro (Power Black 64 GB)  │ POCO  │   4.3   │ ₹10,999 │  38% off │
├─────┼──────────────────────────────────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ 2   │ POCO M4 Pro (Power Black 128 GB) │ POCO  │   4.3   │ ₹11,999 │  40% off │
└─────┴──────────────────────────────────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┘
```

### Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete workflow demonstrating all three skills together:

1. **Ask about seekdb** (seekdb skill):
